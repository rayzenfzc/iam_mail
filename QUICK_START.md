# 🚀 QUICK START - I AM MAIL V5

## To See the New Design:

### Option 1: Incognito Mode (Easiest)
```
1. Open Incognito: Cmd+Shift+N (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+N (Windows)
2. Go to: http://localhost:5001
3. Done! No splash screen, v5 design loads directly
```

### Option 2: Clear Service Worker
```
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Application tab → Service Workers
3. Click "Unregister" next to localhost:5001
4. Hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R
```

## What Changed:

✅ BiometricLogin.tsx (splash screen) → DELETED
✅ App.tsx → Completely rewritten with v5 design
✅ All v5 components → Copied into working app
✅ Real email fetching → Still works!
✅ Service worker cache → Updated to v5-redesign

## Server:

```bash
# Already running on port 5001
# No need to restart - just clear cache
```
